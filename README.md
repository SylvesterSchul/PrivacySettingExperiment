# PrivacySettingExperiment

Purpose: Test how modifying the presentation of privacy settings impacts the user experience and performance of configuration tasks.

Research Question: Can a modified user interface for privacy settings help complete tasks faster, acknowledge users of settings allowing data to enter or leave the website, 
and have a better usability compared to current implementations?

Conditions:

Interface A:
Organized by 5 main catgories identical to the Facebook privacy checkup: Who can see what you share, How people can find you, Your data settings, How to keep your account secure, Your ad preference.
I changed the layout to an all-in-one page for easier implementation and naviagation of the mock settings webpages.
Attempted to configure additional settings that were not included in the orginal Privacy Checkup, but were included in the Settings and Privacy webpage within Facebook.

Interface B: 
Sequential disclosure of settings categorized by high, medium, and low concern.
High Risk includes data flowing from mock website and third party apps.
Medium Risk includes data includes profile visibility and internal tracking within the website.
Low Risk includes Protective features and preferences.

Pre-Experiment Questionnaire:
Gain insight about participants viewpoints on privacy settings that involve data leaving or entering the website based on third party.
Task Experiment:
Choose the right setting configuration based on 9 tasks. Each individual task will be displayed a task and the participant can start the timer and access the privacy settings user interface. 
Measurements include task completion time and setting changed. Please write down these two measurements onto paper after completing a task.
Make sure to differentiate the next button for user interface and the task complete button for Interface B. 
Once pressing the task complete button, it will record the last setting changed and the timer to complete the current task.

IMPORTANT CORRECTION TO EXPLORATORY TASK:
Out of the nine settings that were configured, identify the three tasks that involve controlling future data sharing between Testbook and outside websites or applications.

System Usability Scale:
Determine how useful the mock and experimental user interface are from the ten questions after completing the task experiments.

Ending Notes:
Mock user interface for facebook will not require the participants to use their own account. I made the mock user interface based off of the Privacy Checkup, which is not as extensive as the settings and privacy webpage for facebook and the accounts center for Meta. The three seperate webpages to configure settings made it hard to replicate in a "all-in-one" 
user interface, but it is better than requiring the participant to create and use their own account. Thank you for participating and helping me gather statistics to be used for my
project.
